Learning how to use github

This repository is solely intended for my own self-training on how to use github.  I've made it public in case anything I learn along the way can help someone else flatten their own learning curve.  Please feel free to add your own advice!

Steps involved:
  <ul>
  <li>Create account</li>
  <li>Personalize profile information (photo, name, personal details)</li>
  <li>Explore to "star" topics I'm interested in</li>
  <li>Create this repository & start working on this project to track progress</li>
  <li>More to follow.  Rome wasn't built in a day.</li>
  </ul>
